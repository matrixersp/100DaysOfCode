Hi Tristan,

I'm Mohammed Boudad from Algeria, I have experience in  JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB and many different frontend and backend technologies. most of my work is on Github: https://github.com/matrixersp, most of my tweets are about the work in https://github.com/matrixersp/100DaysOfCode, here are the challenges I solved in Frontendmentor https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/matrixersp, also I solve katas on Codewars https://www.codewars.com/users/matrixersp. I'm knowledgeable in other programming languages including PHP, Java and C++.

PS: I'm not a designer by any means, the reason I have a .design domain is because I got it for free.
